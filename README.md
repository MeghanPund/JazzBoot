# Jazz Bot
## Program Description
A forray into browser automation, featuring selenium. Created purely for my own amusement.

## Note
If you intend to clone this and run it with your own account, you will need to find 
'    username_input.send_keys(secure_info.username)
     password_input.send_keys(secure_info.password) '
and replace 'secure_info.username' with your own username, as well as 'secure_info.password' with your own password.

## Functionality
As of 9 November 2021, this bot only logs in, searches for a hashtag (randomly chosen from a list), and likes posts with that hashtag.

## Future Functionality
1. Follow accounts that meet criteria
2. Comment on posts that meet criteria
3. Streamline the code so it is more efficient and can run faster
